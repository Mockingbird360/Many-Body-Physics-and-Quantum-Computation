# Many-Body-Physics-and-Quantum-Computation
Professor Kareljan Schoutens taught a course called Many Body Physics and Quantum Computation at the GGI SFT 2022 PhD School, February 2022. This reposotory contains jupyter notebooks for different illustrations presented at the lecture, also of some homeworks. Although originally Prof. Schoutens provided codes written in Cirq, I have implemented Qiskit library considering popularity and familiarity. I also provide additional physics details on the notebook.
